# Catalog list

This is a simple SPA that provides a search tool to look for repositories by name.
<br />
Demo at [https://mossen-catalog-list.netlify.app/](https://mossen-catalog-list.netlify.app/)

## Solution architecture

React.js has been used as the main framework and tailwindcss as CSS framwork:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)
- [Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/)
- [Redux rematch](https://github.com/rematch/rematch)
- [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

An input field is designed for user to input a keyword to be searched on Github, as a result a list of repositories containing the keyword in their name will appear.
By scrolling down the list a new request is sent to fetch more repositories.
